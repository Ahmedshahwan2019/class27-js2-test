## Tips for success!

- **Look for low hanging fruit**. Which of the assignments is easiest for you to do? Tackle that one first.
- Make sure that all **syntax is correct** when writing code on paper. For instance: don’t forget brackets or semicolons.
- **If you get stuck in an assignment, move on to the next one**. You can always come back later if time permits.
- After finishing an assignment, read the question again to **make sure you actually gave an answer to the question**.
- Before handing in the test, read it all over again to pick out the small mistakes. **Double check your work!**

Good luck!
