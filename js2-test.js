/* 1. Create a function, named logObj, that:
    - Takes 1 argument: an object, with 3 properties
    - Loops over the object and put each value into a separate variable
    - Concatenates the values into a single string
    - Log to the console the string, including the following: '{NAME} is {AGE} and works as an {JOB}!'
    - Return the string

    Expected output:
    'Noer is 28 and works as an Education Director'
*/

/* 2. Create a function, named logNumbers, that:
      - Takes 2 arguments: a start number and an end number
      - Has a loop that starts from the start number and ends until the end number
      - Log to the console each number, however...
      - If the number is a multiple of 3 output the string “Fizz”,
      - If the number is a multiple of 5 output the string “Buzz”
      - If the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5 output the string “FizzBuzz”
      - Make use of the modulo operator and check for the remainder: %

      Expected output:
      logNumbers(1, 15);
      1
      2
      Fizz
      4
      Buzz
      6
      ...
      13
      14
      FizzBuzz

      Use the following values: 1 (start number) and 100 (end number)

/* 3. Create a function, named toNumbers, that:
      - Takes in 1 argument: an array of strings
      - Get the index position number of each value
      - Create a new array that includes all these numbers 
      - Make use of the map() function
      - Log to the console the array of numbers
      - Return the array of numbers

      Expected output:
      [1, 2, 3, 4]

      Use the following array: const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
*/

/* 4. Create a function, called injectBooksToDOM, that:
      - Takes 1 argument: an array of objects
      - Loops over the array
      - Injects each object's content into the DOM in an unordered list
      - Make use of the forEach() function
      - Returns true if it works, false if it doesn't
  
      Target the '#root' element in 'index.html'.
      Use the following object:
